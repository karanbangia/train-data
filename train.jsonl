{"prompt": "So that's where I was coming. So basically with the margherita, very little tomato sauce. It's for a child and she doesn't like too much of it. So both very less sauce on the bread and on top of the cheese as well, like, very less. And if you don't put anything on the cheese, that would be even better.", "completion": "Understood.

I'm really sorry but I know why this has been happening with you in the past few times as well. So on our online thing, there's an option to choose [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on top or just [ITEM_INGREDIENT] because the [ITEM_NAME] comes with just [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on base. So what the pizza makers have been thinking is you say extra [ITEM_INGREDIENT] so they just put extra [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on base. Well, this is wrong on our side also it should be just one thing like just [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on top or something. But I'm really sorry about it but I was just asking the guys why have you been making this mistake from past so many times? So when they read that, he goes like oh, it says [ITEM_INGREDIENT], just extra [ITEM_INGREDIENT]. So we thought it's just extra [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on base. I'm like well I'll make a pizza for you now. If you want I can deliver it to you straight away. And we'll also credit you this pizza because of the past mistakes we have been making for you."}

{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Cool. Thank you. We'll also change it online but if it's not changed, just make sure you put the [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on top rather than just selecting the [ITEM_INGREDIENT] is okay."}

He could have took that money, no worries. I didn't even know it was there. I checked twice. There's $100 there and whatever. It must have been stuck together, and he came back and gave me the $50.

{"prompt": "Yes, the order was for last night.", "completion": "I apologize for the confusion. Was it meant for pickup or delivery?"}
{"prompt": "It was supposed to be a delivery. I've been charged for delivery as well.", "completion": "I understand. It seems there has been a mistake, as the order came through as pickup. However, we can make it right by sending out your order tonight if that's acceptable to you."}
{"prompt": "That's a bit odd because I never select pickup since I'm out in [LOCATION] [LOCATION].

I'm not really sure. Sorry."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I'm not sure what you guys can do. Are you the manager there?", "completion": "I can go talk to him again."}

Since it was obviously our fault, we ordered the right drinks, and then we're sitting here waiting for him to drop off other deliveries.", "completion": "So what would you like me to check we can do for you? Like I can check with my manager. What would you like me to ask?"}
{"prompt": "Just what does he think that's appropriate? His business.

I'll see if he's busy or not. I'll take. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. Sorry again. My boss is a bit busy at the moment because the kitchen is a bit hectic. But he can call you back later tonight when it's quieter to speak about it. But the driver will be on his way as soon as he can and get those to you, if that's okay."}
{"prompt": "Yes. So am I still paying for it then?", "completion": "I'd say so. Unless when I tell the manager to call you later when he's free, he might be able to speak to you about that."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but do I pay the driver or not?", "completion": "So you've already paid for the order, right?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, no, I haven't paid for it yet because he was supposed to come back and bring the drinks straight away. I didn't think it was his dropping off other orders and doing.", "completion": "You say you haven't paid for it?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "I'd say just pay for them, but then we can call our manager after."}
{"prompt": "Well, there's probably. Yeah, if your manager is busy, tell the guy not to worry about bringing the drinks. I won't give him the money yet until I sort it out with your manager. The manager can just give me a call when I'm pretty sure. Got five minutes to talk to an unhappy customer?", "completion": "Yeah. So did you not want the drinks to be taken to you?"}
{"prompt": "No, there's no point. It's nearly 45 minutes later. So, yeah, I'd rather just sort it out with your manager first and see what he's actually going to do about it rather than pay for everything that's not really been up to scratch, you know what I mean? Like, I'd like to speak to him first and see what he wants to do in regards to it all.", "completion": "Yeah, so we won't send the drinks with you. And do you mind if I just take your phone number and when he's ready. So what was your phone number? Sorry?"}
{"prompt": "[PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER].", "completion": "Yes. [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER]. And just so when he's free, as soon as possible, I'll get him to ring you about that."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Okay. So they're not obviously bringing the drinks. I'll just wait for his call.", "completion": "Yeah. Okay."}
{"prompt": "All right. Thank you.", "completion": "Sorry. Bye. That's okay."}

{"prompt": "So the vegetarian pizza was meant to come with sauce on it, but there was no sauce on it when I came home and had a look at it, which isn't really so much of an issue. It was a fair bit overcooked and there was not nearly as much topping on it as there usually is.", "completion": "I'm sorry to hear that. Were you wanting us to remake it?"}

We order with you quite regularly, and these pizzas are rather small compared to what they usually are. Has there been a size change from what is [ITEM_SIZE]?"}
{"prompt": "Give me 2 seconds. He orders quite regularly and I'm 100%.", "completion": "Sure it's a [ITEM_SIZE] pizza. We'll just tell him we'll make it again. We'll bring it, but we'll have to check those pizzas."}
{"prompt": "I'm 100% sure, but, so we can make those pizzas again for you and send them out, but we'll just have to receive both of the pizzas back from you just to make sure that they're the wrong size.", "completion": "Okay. Yeah, so we'll just make the barbecue chicken and the country special again for you and. Yeah, just when the driver gets there. Is it possible if you could send a photo as well?"}
{"prompt": "How to send a photo? How to send a photo just through message?", "completion": "Yes, I'll just give the number."}
{"prompt": "So I'll just give you my manager's phone number and just message that to him. So his phone number. Do you have a pen there?", "completion": "I don't. The reception here is not that great, so I might not be able to send a photo."}
{"prompt": "I'll just give you his phone number anyways, just so we can sort that out. Yeah. I don't have a pen and paper on me. I'm actually outside of my house because the reception inside is not very good.", "completion": "Doesn't have good reception."}
{"prompt": "I'm, like, 200% sure those are too large.", "completion": "So. Yeah, don't worry about that. We'll just make them again and just give us back the two pizzas that were the wrong size. Okay, thank you."}

{"prompt": "That'll be it.", "completion": "Okay, that's fine. That is ordered. That's $19 and you should be able to pick it up in about 20 minutes. Okay."}
{"prompt": "[PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME].", "completion": "Let me have a look. I'm so sorry. That's fine. Yes, that's on a pickup. Did you want to make that into a delivery?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, please.", "completion": "Okay, one second. Let me try and get you connected to the front desk. If that doesn't work out, I'll do that myself. But let me just have a look first."}
{"prompt": "Thank you. I'm so sorry.", "completion": "No, that's fine. It's all good. I'm going to go ahead and transfer you now."}

{"prompt": "No worries. So that one's just going to be a $5 delivery fee. Were you wanting to pay cash on delivery or just now?", "completion": "I can pay on card now, if that's okay."}
{"prompt": "Card now? Yeah. So what was your card number?", "completion": "Sorry? [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER]."}
{"prompt": "[CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER].", "completion": "Yes."}

The card number being [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER] and the expiry [CREDIT_CARD_EXPIRATION]. And the CVV [CREDIT_CARD_CVV] [CREDIT_CARD_CVV] [CREDIT_CARD_CVV]? Yes, that's correct."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, no worries. I was just loading it. Might take a second. It's all good.", "completion": "No worries. That one's gone through. Should be about an hour."}
{"prompt": "I said, can I have your phone number?", "completion": "Could you please provide your phone number?"}

{"prompt": "Yeah, that's fine.", "completion": "Okay, so a gluten free vegetarian pizza. Done. What else, please?"}
{"prompt": "And just how much is a medium like the standard? What's the difference in prices between a medium and a large? Just standard pizzas.", "completion": "Right. Okay, I'll give you an idea. So essentially, a [ITEM_SIZE] would be $18. And then gluten free [ITEM_SIZE] is $21, [ITEM_SIZE] is $23, [ITEM_SIZE] is $28, and [ITEM_SIZE] is $33."}
{"prompt": "Alright, so we'll grab a large and just a normal base. And it will be a barbecue chicken, please.", "completion": "Barbecue chicken. Just before you move to any further item, just want to let you know we have a deal of two [ITEM_SIZE] pizzas. That is $41.50."}

{"prompt": "Yeah. Thank you.", "completion": "Okay, that one selected. Anything else?"}
{"prompt": "No, that's it. Thanks.", "completion": "Okay. No drinks either?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Okay, sure. I'll repeat what I have. So it's a vegetarian, gluten free pizza, which is a [ITEM_SIZE] size only, which is $21. And the other pizza is a chicken barbecue [ITEM_SIZE] pizza, which is $23, $26. That is, the total comes down to approximately $47. All the way?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, no worries.", "completion": "Okay. Will this be picked up at a certain time? Because the earliest you can do is 20 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, 20 minutes is fine.", "completion": "Perfect. See you then. Thanks very much."}

{"prompt": "And I'll get a half margarita and half Hawaiian with cheese on top.", "completion": "With cheese on both sides. Okay."}
{"prompt": "Actually, I'll just get a large Hawaiian. Just half of it. No pineapple and cheese on top.", "completion": "Instead of the half Margherita, you'd like a whole Hawaiian?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "With cheese on top. Would you like just no pineapple on half of it?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Okay. Anything else?"}
{"prompt": "That's all, thanks.", "completion": "Thank you. Let me just add the garlic bread. So you've got a [ITEM_SIZE] Mexicana, a [ITEM_SIZE] Capricciosa. A main penne, a chicken pesto. You've got a [ITEM_SIZE] Hawaiian with [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on top, but you've got the pineapples removed on half. And you've got a serving of garlic bread. Yes, thank you. That's $89.40. And you can pick that up in 20 minutes."}
{"prompt": "It's $5 for delivery, and it's a minimum of $30.", "completion": "Okay, I'll be there soon to pick it up then."}
{"prompt": "All right, excellent. Thank you.", "completion": "Bye."}
{"prompt": "Certainly. I'll just transfer your call to management who deal with bookings and they can do that for you.", "completion": "Thank you."}

{"prompt": "Please grab a large barbecue chicken with no onion.", "completion": "A [ITEM_SIZE] barbecue chicken pizza with no [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on there?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Okay. Just so that you know, there's no [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on barbecue chicken pizza anyway, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "What's the other one? I like the wrong one for you.", "completion": "I think it could be the meat lovers pizza. Because that contains [ITEM_INGREDIENT] in it."}
{"prompt": "No, it's not meat lovers.", "completion": "I'll read the ingredients to you. So it's tomato sauce, barbecue chicken, cheese, and again. And barbecue sauce on top."}
{"prompt": "It's the barbecue pizza with no onion. It has onion in it?", "completion": "Yeah. Is that the one you want or you want the chicken barbecue pizza?"}
